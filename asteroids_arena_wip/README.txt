Notes about this clone
======================
This is cloned from a local diretory, i.e. on this computer/file system.
- The local directory is connected to a GitHub repository (not GitHub Pages, though)

This clone has 2 remotes:
- The "origin" remote is set to the local file system. This is where we will pull from (to get whatever code changes we made to the game's source code)
- The "ghpages" remote is set to GitHub pages, NOT the local dir. This is where we will push
